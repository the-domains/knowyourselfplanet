We believe that we all deserve to transform the experiences of our lives so we can experience more joy, worry less and serve more people to do the same.

Though we spend an inordinate amount of time with ourselves, strangely, **it's remarkably hard to develop a proper understanding of how we operate: what we want, how we feel and why we react as we do**.

This lack of self-knowledge can be acutely dangerous. It makes us get into the wrong relationships, pick unsatisfactory jobs and spend money unwisely.

No wonder Socrates summed up all the counsel of philosophy in just two words: '**Know Yourself**'.

_Our vision is_ to build a community that will provide you with the clarity, inspiration & support you need to know & love yourself & create and live the life you want. 

Share your story and inspire yourself and others to do the same!
